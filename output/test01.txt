S01: [00:00:00]  So welcome to this interview today. I'm sitting here with Natalie and we're going to have just a little interview with two questions.
S01: [00:00:08]  My name is Lars and I'm handing over to my interviewee to introduce herself.
S00: [00:00:15]  Thank you. My name is Natalie. I'm an employee at GAG and we are testing this new device.
S01: [00:00:22]  Okay, thank you. My first question to you is, when is your next field trip?
S00: [00:00:30]  That is a good question, Lars. I'm not sure. We are hoping for May.
S01: [00:00:34]  Okay, you're hoping for May. When was your last field trip?
S00: [00:00:39]  I last went in July.
S01: [00:00:41]  Okay, thank you very much for the interview.
