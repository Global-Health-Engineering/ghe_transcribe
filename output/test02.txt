S00: [00:00:00]  So hi Fiona, we're here to record an audio that I will use for testing.
S01: [00:00:10]  Hi Nicolo, thanks so much for the honor to invite me to help you on this project.
S00: [00:00:18]  You're welcome, you were the first person that came to mind. So we're here to ask you a couple of questions until we reach minute one. So what do you do in life Fiona?
S02: [00:00:34]  Good question, good question. So at the moment I do an internship, it's going great, everything I do is productive, will be published probably by tomorrow.
S02: [00:00:46]  Yeah, just doing the grind, just yeah. Of course. Do you have plans for lunch?
S02: [00:00:53]  Plans for lunch? Yes, actually I do, I'm meeting a friend.
S02: [00:00:56]  If you want, you're welcome to join. Perfect, thank you very much.
